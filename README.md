# Token Bar
This is a Foundry VTT module for pulling *every* player to a specific scene. If you have a large party and they are across various scenes, this adds a shortcut to pull the party together quickly  and easily.


# Installation
1. Inside Foundry's Configuration and Setup screen, go to **Add-on Modules**
2. Click "Install Module"
3. In the Manifest URL field paste: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kekilla0/TokenBar/module.json`

# Usage

Once activated, select a token that has an actor/character sheet associated with it. You will see an action bar that is populated with features/actions/skills for that particular token.
